# AI in Marketing — MECE Framework

## High-Level Categories (with definitions)
- **Strategy & Use-Case Selection** — decide where AI creates net value within marketing.
- **Acquisition & Growth** — drive qualified demand using AI-augmented channels.
- **Retention & Lifecycle** — increase LTV via personalisation and automation.
- **Data & Measurement** — collect, model and attribute outcomes safely.
- **Operations & Governance** — scale AI responsibly and efficiently.

## Subcategories
### Strategy & Use-Case Selection
- **Opportunity Sizing** — estimate impact/effort of candidate use-cases.
- **Risk & Compliance** — GDPR/consent/model governance checks.
- **Pilot Design** — MVP scope, metrics and success thresholds.

### Acquisition & Growth
- **Predictive Targeting** — propensity modelling for paid/email.
- **Content Automation** — brief-to-draft workflows for ads/blogs/assets.
- **SEO Automation** — entity mapping, internal linking, technical checks.

### Retention & Lifecycle
- **Next-Best-Action** — trigger offers and nudges per user state.
- **Churn Prediction** — flag at-risk accounts for save plays.
- **Support Automation** — agent deflection and assist.

### Data & Measurement
- **Data Pipelines** — CDP/warehouse readiness and tracking.
- **Attribution & MMM** — unified view for budget decisions.
- **Experimentation** — A/B and causal testing guardrails.

### Operations & Governance
- **Workflow Design** — templates, approvals and SLAs.
- **Model Ops** — evaluation, cost control, fallback plans.
- **Security & Privacy** — PII handling, consent logs, vendor checks.

## Distinctness Notes
- **Acquisition & Growth vs Retention & Lifecycle** — different lifecycle goals/KPIs (new pipeline vs LTV).
- **Data & Measurement vs Operations & Governance** — data = truth/attribution; ops = process/risk.

## Coverage Checklist (Aspect → Category)
- Paid media efficiency → Acquisition & Growth  
- Personalised onboarding → Retention & Lifecycle  
- Attribution accuracy → Data & Measurement  
- Approval workflows → Operations & Governance  
- Use-case ROI → Strategy & Use-Case Selection

## Edge Cases & Trade-offs
- Content Automation could live under Ops; kept in Acquisition due to revenue impact.
- Support Automation overlaps CS; placed in Retention for LTV linkage.

## MECE Confirmation
- **Mutually exclusive** because each category has a distinct mission, owner and KPI set.  
- **Collectively exhaustive** because together they span selection, execution, measurement and scaling.
